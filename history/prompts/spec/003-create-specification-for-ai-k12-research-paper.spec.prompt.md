Research Standards ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - Source Count: Minimum 8 unique sources. - Source Quality: Peer-reviewed academic journals or government education reports. - Recency: All sources must be published within the last 10 years (2014-2024). - Citation Style: APA 7th Edition (Embedded in text + Reference list). 5. Structural Outline ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I. Title Page & Abstract (150-250 words) II. Introduction - The current efficiency crisis in K-12 (Teacher burnout/Retention). - Thesis statement linking AI to operational efficiency. III. Methodology (Brief overview of literature selection). IV. Analysis: AI in Assessment (Data & Findings). V. Analysis: AI in Personalized Learning (Data & Findings). VI. Analysis: AI in Administration (Data & Findings). VII. Discussion: The ROI of Classroom AI - Synthesis of time saved vs. implementation cost. - Impact on student metrics. VIII. Conclusion IX. References (APA Format). 6. Constraints & Boundaries ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Word Count: 3,000 - 5,000 words. Format: Markdown (.md). Out of Scope (Do Not Include): - Comparisons of specific commercial products (e.g., no "Tool A vs. Tool B"). - Deep dives into ethical implications, privacy, or bias (topic for a different paper). - Implementation manuals or technical code snippets. - Speculative "Sci-Fi" future predictions (focus on current technology). 7. Success Metrics ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - Logic Check: Does the conclusion directly follow from the cited evidence? - Clarity: Can a non-technical administrator explain the benefits after reading? - Verification: Are there 3+ distinct concrete application examples? - Integrity: 0% plagiarism; all claims traceable to primary sources.

## Response snapshot

Feature specification created and validated. All critical specification quality checks passed. The item "Dependencies and assumptions identified" was noted as partially covered; however, it does not warrant a clarification question at this stage due to its low impact for this type of feature.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the initial specification (`specs/001-ai-k12-research/spec.md`) and a corresponding quality checklist (`specs/001-ai-k12-research/checklists/requirements.md`) for the "Research Paper: AI Impact on K-12 Classroom Efficiency" feature. The specification passed all critical quality checks.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run. Manual validation of the spec against the generated checklist was performed.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/001-ai-k12-research/spec.md` and `specs/001-ai-k12-research/checklists/requirements.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.plan` to begin architectural planning.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully parsed a detailed natural language feature description and translated it into a structured specification and a quality checklist, adhering to the specified template and validation rules. Overcame initial challenges with `create-new-feature.ps1` by correctly interpreting its behavior.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `create-new-feature.ps1` initially failed due to incorrect parameter passing with a long string, but was resolved by passing the feature description as a separate positional argument as per the script's intended design.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Passed all critical checklist items. One minor item (`Dependencies and assumptions identified`) was noted as partially covered.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Improve `create-new-feature.ps1` to be more robust against various ways `ARGUMENTS` might be passed.

# "PhysicalAI Academy" Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Embodied Intelligence
Theory meets physical reality. The project bridges digital AI knowledge with physical robotics implementation through simulations and real-world applications.

### II. Accessible Learning
The textbook and its examples must work on varied and accessible hardware configurations to ensure a wide audience can participate.

### III. AI-Native Design
Leverage AI agents, such as Claude, for content generation, maintenance, and to create an interactive learning experience. This includes the integration of a RAG-powered AI chatbot.

### IV. Open Source
Development is transparent and community-driven, hosted on GitHub. Contributions are encouraged, and the content is freely available.

## Target Audience and Success Metrics

**Target Audience:**
- Students learning robotics (0-5 years experience)
- Software engineers transitioning to physical systems
- Hardware enthusiasts with an AI background
- International learners (with Urdu support as a priority)

**Success Metrics:**
- Complete 4-module curriculum (13 weeks).
- Functional RAG chatbot integrated into the book.
- Authentication system with personalization.
- Deploy live on GitHub Pages by Nov 30, 2025.

## Constraints and Technology Stack

**Constraints & Tech Stack:**
- **Tech Stack:** Docusaurus, OpenAI, FastAPI, Neon Postgres, Qdrant
- **Bonus Features:** Subagents, Better-Auth, Urdu translation, Content personalization

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, formal approval, and a clear migration plan. All contributions and reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified against the principle of Accessible Learning.
